We began this project with a simple goal, to make Cole’s glasses more interesting and to have fun with the project. We figured the perfect solution would be to 3D print some accessories that could attach right onto the glasses and bring humor to an otherwise mundane object. We each decided to pick a different part of the glasses as our attachment points, Cole chose the lenses, Skylar the hinges, and Karen the temple. After some group sketches, Cole decided to make wing attachments, Skylar decided to make the text, “PIMP”, and Karen decided to make the text, “COLE.” 
We each started by taking measurements of the chosen attachment points of the glasses, then we modeled in Sketchup and/or OpenSCAD to print simple prototypes to test the measurements and different connection methods. After a few attempts each, we had parts that fit snugly and securely on the frames. Some problems that we had were that the side, temple attachments worked but were a little fragile, and the Pimp logo had to be repaired/glued after a small piece broke while taking off the support material. Overall, we had a successful pair of extremely tacky eyeglasses with a striking color palette.
